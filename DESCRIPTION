Description: The SAGA package covers a line of functions for automated severity assessment and transformation
    predictions of surrogate assays. The user may use the functions of this package to upload arrays in order
    to classify them either as "transforming or nontransforming". The package relies on a well-balanced and optimized
    model of surrogate assays and thus serves as a robust basis for the prediction of un-trained data.
